1. if we change some files before pull we need stash this file.
2. if changes is not needed discard and take pull using below command 



git pull origin dev_branch name --> for pull

after that 
check 2-3 your in vs code updated changes is reflected or not 

by thamb stash ch command lihun ja ky ast te op

1. stash --> use to store all your changed file in one directory 

git stash --> use to stash your files 

after stash we can don following action 

1.create new branch -- its  only for new branch creation 
2. take pull 

example - 
1. suppose you are doing changes in staging file. but your changes is affected on exiting changes 
that time senior suggested you to create new branch. but you did changes in staging 
that time used 

git stash

then your changes is store and you are able to create new branch 

then use 

git pop --? use to restore your stash files 

then git add.

git commit 

git push 

code changes successfully push in new branch 

this is all about flow .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. take pull --> if we have exiting branches and we want updated code 

that time we need to take pull from origin branch like staging pull in swati_1
